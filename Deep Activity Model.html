						<p class = "description"> Human mobility significantly impacts various aspects of society, including transportation, urban planning, and public health. The increasing availability of diverse
mobility data and advancements in deep learning have revolutionized mobility
modeling. Existing deep learning models, however, mainly study spatio-temporal
patterns using trajectories and often fall short in capturing the underlying semantic
interdependency among activities. Moreover, they are also constrained by the data
source. These two factors thereby limit their realism and adaptability, respectively.
Meanwhile, traditional activity-based models (ABMs) in transportation modeling
rely on rigid assumptions and are costly and time-consuming to calibrate, making
them difficult to adapt and scale to new regions, especially those regions with limited amount of required conventional travel data. To address these limitations, we
develop a novel generative deep learning approach for human mobility modeling
and synthesis, using ubiquitous and open-source data. Additionally, the model can
be fine-tuned with local data, enabling adaptable and accurate representations of
mobility patterns across different regions. The model is evaluated on a nationwide
dataset of the United States, where it demonstrates superior performance in generating activity chains that closely follow ground truth distributions. Further tests
using state- or city-specific datasets from California, Washington, and Mexico City
confirm its transferability. This innovative approach offers substantial potential
to advance mobility modeling research, especially in generating human activity
chains as input for downstream activity-based mobility simulation models and
providing enhanced tools for urban planners and policymakers. </p>
